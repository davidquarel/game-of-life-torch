# Game of Life Visualization

This project visualizes the evolution of Conway's Game of Life, leveraging Plotly for visualization and PyTorch for computing the generational update rule.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the simulation:

1. **Install the required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python game_of_life.py
   ```

   However, the script also supports various command-line arguments for customization:

   - `--height`: Specifies the height of the simulation grid. Default is 64.
   - `--width`: Specifies the width of the simulation grid. Default is 64.
   - `--seed`: Sets the seed for random initialization, allowing for reproducible simulations. By default, it is `None`, which results in a random seed.
   - `--alive_fraction`: Determines the fraction of cells that are initially alive. Default value is 0.2.

   ```bash
   python game_of_life.py --height 100 --width 100 --seed 42 --alive_fraction 0.1
   ```

After running the script, a browser window should automatically open displaying the Game of Life simulation. You can observe how the initial configuration evolves over time according to the rules of the Game of Life.
